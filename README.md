## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The primary purpose of the Min-Max algorithm is to make optimal decisions in two-player games with perfect information. In these games, both players have complete knowledge of the current game state, and the outcome is solely determined by the players' decisions. The Min-Max algorithm helps a player decide the best move at each turn by considering all possible moves and their potential outcomes.

The goal of this document is to offer a thorough understanding of the Min-Max algorithm, providing insights into its underlying principles, implementation details, and potential enhancements through optimizations.

### 1.2 Background
The Min-Max algorithm finds its roots in game theory, a branch of mathematics and economics that deals with the analysis of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. Introduced as a decision-making tool, the Min-Max algorithm was initially designed to determine the optimal strategy for players in turn-based games.

In turn-based games, players take sequential turns, and each player aims to maximize their chances of winning. The Min-Max algorithm systematically evaluates all possible moves and outcomes, creating a game tree that represents the entire decision space. By assigning values to different game states, the algorithm assists players in making informed decisions to maximize their advantage or minimize their disadvantage.

### 1.3 Terminology
- **Maximizer:** The player employs the Min-Max algorithm, aiming to maximize the objective function, which is often a measure of the desirability or advantage of a game state. The maximizer seeks the move that leads to the highest possible evaluation.
- **Minimizer:** The opponent, aiming to minimize the objective function. The minimizer acts in opposition to the maximizer, seeking moves that lead to lower evaluations for the maximizer.
- **Depth:** Refers to the level of recursion in the game tree. As the Min-Max algorithm explores the decision tree, it goes deeper into levels of possible moves. The depth influences the algorithm's ability to consider long-term strategies and the computational complexity of the problem.
- **Terminal State:** Represents the end state of the game, where no more moves are possible. Terminal states are crucial for determining the outcome and are typically associated with win/loss conditions or draws.
Understanding these terms is essential for grasping the dynamics of the Min-Max algorithm. The maximizer and minimizer players alternate turns, and the algorithm's recursive nature allows it to explore the decision space efficiently, ultimately leading to optimal decision-making in turn-based games with perfect information.

## 2. Algorithm Overview
### 2.1 Basic Idea
The fundamental idea behind the Min-Max algorithm is to systematically explore the decision space represented by the game tree. The game tree is a graphical representation of all possible moves and their consequences in a turn-based game. Min-Max assigns values to each node in the tree based on an objective function, helping players make decisions that lead to the most favorable outcomes.

In the context of the Min-Max algorithm, the nodes in the game tree are categorized into two types:

- **Maximizer Nodes:** These nodes represent the current player's turn, and the objective is to maximize the outcome. The algorithm explores these nodes by considering all possible moves available to the player and evaluates the resulting game states.
- **Minimizer Nodes:** These nodes represent the opponent's turn, and the objective is to minimize the outcome from the maximizer's perspective. The algorithm explores these nodes by considering all possible moves available to the opponent and evaluates the resulting game states.
By systematically evaluating and assigning values to nodes, the Min-Max algorithm guides the decision-making process, helping the player choose moves that lead to the most favorable positions.

### 2.2 Objective Function
The objective function is a crucial component of the Min-Max algorithm. It serves as a metric for quantifying the desirability of a particular game state from the perspective of the player. The objective function typically considers factors such as the current position of pieces, control of the board, potential threats, and other relevant aspects of the game.

The goal of the objective function is to provide a numerical representation of the advantages or disadvantages associated with a specific game state. Positive values often indicate an advantageous position for the player, while negative values suggest a disadvantage. By incorporating the objective function, the Min-Max algorithm can prioritize moves that lead to more favorable positions.

### 2.3 Turn-Taking
Turn-taking is a critical aspect of the Min-Max algorithm, as it reflects the sequential nature of turn-based games. Players alternate making moves and the algorithm adapts to this turn-taking structure. The algorithm starts at the root of the game tree, representing the current game state, and systematically explores the tree by considering all possible moves.

As the algorithm explores the tree, it alternates between maximizing and minimizing nodes. During the maximizer's turn, the algorithm seeks moves that maximize the objective function, aiming to increase the advantage. Conversely, during the minimizer's turn, the algorithm seeks moves that minimize the objective function, attempting to reduce the advantage from the maximizer's perspective.

This turn-taking mechanism continues until a terminal state is reached, signaling the end of the game. At this point, the algorithm has assigned values to all relevant nodes in the tree, and the player can choose the move associated with the most favorable outcome.

In summary, the Min-Max algorithm's basic idea involves exploring the game tree, utilizing an objective function to evaluate nodes, and incorporating turn-taking to guide decision-making in turn-based games with perfect information.

## 3. Pseudocode
### 3.1 Initialization
The Min-Max algorithm begins by initializing the game tree with the current game state. The algorithm then proceeds to explore the tree, assigning values to nodes and ultimately determining the best move for the player.

```
function MinMax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer)
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer
        bestValue := -∞
        for each child of node
            val := MinMax(child, depth - 1, FALSE)
            bestValue := max(bestValue, val)
        return bestValue
    else
        bestValue := +∞
        for each child of node
            val := MinMax(child, depth - 1, TRUE)
            bestValue := min(bestValue, val)
        return bestValue
```

### 3.2 Recursion
The Min-Max algorithm utilizes recursion to explore the game tree. The algorithm starts at the root node, representing the current game state, and proceeds to explore the tree by considering all possible moves. The algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing nodes, assigning values to each node based on the objective function.

### 3.3 Evaluation Function
The evaluation function is a crucial component of the Min-Max algorithm. It serves as a metric for quantifying the desirability of a particular game state from the perspective of the player. The evaluation function typically considers factors such as the current position of pieces, control of the board, potential threats, and other relevant aspects of the game.

```
function evaluate(board)
    if board is a terminal node
        return value of board
    else
        return heuristic value of board
```
